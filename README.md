# Statistical Learning Approaches to the Socioeconomic Determinants of Social Relegation

This repository includes the code used in the Bachelor Thesis **"Statistical Learning Approaches to the Socioeconomic Determinants of Social Relegation"** by Khalil Belghouat.

In this thesis, we apply 12 supervised learning methods on a social exclusion and marginalisation data set for the purpose of binary classification. We obtained as a result that great importance was attributed to the individual’s mastery of the french language, his ability to secure an internship, as well as his gender in almost all of the utilised supervised learning methods. These variables were to a large extent the deciding factors of the person’s social status. As a consequence of the data set being imbalanced, we used Cohen’s \kappa to evaluate the performance of each model. We found that random forests, and ensemble methods in general, have outperformed them all while decision trees had the worst out-of-sample performance.
